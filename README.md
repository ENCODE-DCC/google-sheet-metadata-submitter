https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mmTsrT4tnD4fRAf7nkdduq810nZvMQxZy0ga4Z_zK74/edit?usp=sharing


## Grant permission first

Grant permissions for the script to access your data on the sheet/account.


## Authorization (username/password)

Go to portail's Profile page and get credentials pair (username/password).
Go to `ENCODE` - `Authorize`. Credentials entered here will be shared for all sheets in the whole spreadsheet, but **NOT SHARED WITH OTHERS EVEN WHEN THEY MAKE A COPY OF YOUR SPREADSHEET**.


## Set a profile name

Go to `ENCODE` - `Set profile name` and enter a valid profile name. A profile name in snakecase or capitalized CamelCase are allowed. For example, `experiment`, `Expertiment`, `biosample_type` and `BiosampleType`. Such profile name should be set for each sheet.


## Check your current profile

Go to `ENCODE` - `Show sheet/header info`.


## Special commented headers

Data values under commented headers will be ignored and not be sent to the portal.

- `#skip`: For all REST actions (GET/PUT/POST). You can additionally make `#skip` header and set row's data cell as 1 to skip REST actions for that specific row.
- `#error`: For debugging purposese. This is filled with `HTTP ERROR CODE` + `HELP TEXT MESSAGE` for any recent REST action.


## Make a POST template based on profile

Once you set a valid profile name, go to `ENCODE` - `Make new template row`. This will make a new row with empty/default values for each property. This templatre include ALL editable properties for a given profile. Some of them are shown but not editable (e.g. `schema_version` and `accession`).


## GET metadata from portal

Make a new header with a proper identifying property (`accession` or `uuid` according to the given profile). And then define accession/uuids you want to retrieve from the portal under the header. Go to `ENCODE` - `Get metadata for all raws`. 


## PUT metadata to portal

GET metadata from portal first and then edit it. Set `#skip` as `0` if it is present and then go to `ENCODE` - `PUT all rows to the portal` .


## POST metadata to portal

Starting from a template or existing metadata (retrieved from GET), set `#skip` as `0` if it is present and then go to `ENCODE` - `POST all rows to the portal` .


## How to debug?

Any REST (GET/PUT/POST) action will return `HTTP ERROR CODE` + `HELP TEXT MESSAGE` in the `#error` column. Fix your problem with the help message and resubmit.


## How to search for items on portal

Go to a data cell and hover your mouse on the header (1st row) of the column and check if it's shown as `SEARCH AVAILABLE` in its tooltop. On a data cell that you want to edit, go to `ENCODE` - `Search`. Then you will see a dialog box to edit your values.
